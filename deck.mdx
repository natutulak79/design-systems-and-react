# Design Systems at GitHub

---

Design systems are..

# Rules, Principles, & Constraints

---

# implemented in design & code

---

**Rule:** minimum color contrast ratio of 4:5:1

**Constraint:** number of colors in the palette

**Principle:** use color in a meaningful way

# GitHub is 10 years old 🎂

# 10 years

of people contributing design and code (debt) 😅

# Ruby on Rails

partials & helpers != components

# 🚂  we can't stop the train

We can't stop everything to build the perfect system.
```

---

# Primer

GitHub's design system

---

**O**bject **O**riented **CSS**

**B**lock **E**lement **M**odifier

Atomic / Functional / **Utility-centric CSS**

---

People no longer had to write much CSS

---

Easier to design in the browser

---

Styles based on systems, worked more harmoniously, flexible but consistent.

---

Obvious and transparent

---

# Problems

export default QuoteLayout

```html
<div class="bg-gray-light border border-black-fade rounded p-2 p-md-4 p-lg-6 my-4">
```

```notes
Lots of classes in the markup.
```

export default QuoteLayout

```html
<div class="border p-2 rounded">
  <input class="form-input form-input--large">
  </input>
  <button class="btn btn--primary ml-2">
    Search
  </button>
</div>
```

```notes
Lots of repeated markup
```

```scss
.wiki-list {

  em {
    padding: 3px;
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: $font-weight-bold;
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 140, 0.5);
    border-radius: 3px;
  }

  .description {
    margin: 0 0 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
    line-height: 20px;
  }

  .wiki-list-item + .wiki-list-item {
    border-top: $border;
  }
}
```

```scss
.issue-list {

  em {
    padding: 3px;
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: $font-weight-bold;
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 140, 0.5);
    border-radius: 3px;
  }

  .description {
    margin: 0 0 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
    line-height: 20px;
  }

  .issue-list-item + .issue-list-item {
    border-top: $border;
  }
}
```

```notes
The only thing that's different is the name of the class selector.

# Presentational vs Container components

Presentational components are concerned with _how things look_

// All components
